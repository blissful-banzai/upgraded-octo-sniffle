# upgraded-octo-sniffle
small repo to count BTC mentions on Twitter.
## 
This repository uses the standard twitter API. The search can be configured 
in the json file. `search_queries` and `search_kwargs` need to be of the same
length. For selecting the search query and kwargs, see examples in https://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/api.html
and also in https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-to-apis/twitter-data-in-python/
